Week of Learning (HTML/CSS/JS ES6)
It's a website where you can connect with your friends just like social media, but you could compete with them. 
Users can post concepts, challenges and practice questions for other users. 
The more challenges you solve, the more points you score. 

**IMPORTANT**
Most functionalities used in this project are dummies as to implement them real time we would need PHP and MySQL which weren't allowed for us.
